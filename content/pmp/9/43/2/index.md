## 43.2 Cross-Reference to PMBOK® Guide Topics

This section provides a comprehensive cross-reference between the chapters of “Mastering Project Management: A Comprehensive Companion for the PMP® Exam” and the PMBOK® Guide (Seventh Edition). By mapping each relevant chapter to the corresponding areas of the PMBOK® Guide, you will have a clear roadmap for connecting the content in this book with PMI’s official standard. This synergy allows you to merge your understanding of principles, performance domains, and approaches—both predictive and agile—ensuring you gain the most value from the PMBOK® Guide’s structure when preparing for the PMP® exam.

Many of the chapters in this book also incorporate knowledge from the PMBOK® Guide Sixth Edition, the Agile Practice Guide, and supplemental standards like PMIstandards+. However, our primary objective here is to help you locate similar or complementary concepts in the PMBOK® Guide Seventh Edition so that your learning process is both efficient and thorough.

## Purpose of This Cross-Reference

• Bridge the gap between the PMBOK® Guide Seventh Edition and the chapters of this book.  
• Pinpoint where key principles, performance domains, and methods from PMBOK® 7th appear in this companion text.  
• Facilitate a more focused study regimen: If you are exploring a specific PMBOK® principle or performance domain, you can see immediately which chapters in this book deepen that topic.  
• Highlight why certain chapters in this book might expand upon or diverge from traditional frameworks—offering real-world, advanced insights that extend the PMBOK® Guide’s base content.

## PMBOK® Guide Seventh Edition: A Structural Overview

The PMBOK® Guide Seventh Edition spotlights Principles and Performance Domains, a shift from the process-based framework of earlier editions. It groups project management understanding into:

- Twelve project management principles (broad guidelines and mindsets):  
  1. Stewardship.  
  2. Team.  
  3. Stakeholders.  
  4. Value.  
  5. Systems Thinking.  
  6. Leadership.  
  7. Tailoring.  
  8. Quality.  
  9. Complexity.  
  10. Risk.  
  11. Adaptability and Resilience.  
  12. Change Management.  

- Eight performance domains focusing on key areas of project functioning:  
  1. Stakeholder.  
  2. Team.  
  3. Development Approach and Life Cycle.  
  4. Planning.  
  5. Project Work.  
  6. Delivery.  
  7. Measurement.  
  8. Uncertainty.  

These form the backbone of how project managers navigate projects in agile, hybrid, or predictive contexts. The PMBOK® Guide also emphasizes tailoring, ensuring you adapt methods and artifacts to fit the unique environment and constraints of your project.

## General Navigation Guidance

In the tables and narrative below, you will find references to chapters within “Mastering Project Management” that parallel or expand upon concepts in PMBOK® 7th Edition. Where relevant, we also note intersections with prior editions (particularly PMBOK® 6th) or other PMI materials like the Agile Practice Guide.

For ease of reference, we will use the following notations:

• Principle references: “(Principle x)” where x is the principle number in PMBOK® 7.  
• Performance domain references: “(Domain X)” where X is one of the eight performance domains.  
• Other PMBOK® elements like models, methods, and artifacts will be indicated as relevant.

## Practical Examples and Case Studies

Below are a few short illustrations showing how chapters in this book directly complement PMBOK® 7 content:

1. Stakeholder Domain (Domain 1) and Chapter 7:  
   • Example: A healthcare company implementing a new patient records system references Chapter 7 to identify main stakeholders (physicians, nurses, administration, and IT). PMBOK® 7 Domain 1 ensures a continuous stakeholder engagement plan is in place, with multiple feedback forums and conflict resolution strategies.  
   • Outcome: Avoiding late-stage requirement changes and ensuring strong adoption by end users.

2. Planning Domain (Domain 4) and Chapter 10:  
   • Scenario: A software team employing rolling wave planning uses Chapter 10’s best practices to break down release schedules, referencing PMBOK® 7 Domain 4 to ensure that new knowledge gained in each sprint leads to immediate plan adjustment.  
   • Benefit: Helps the team respond quickly to changing competition or technology updates.

3. Uncertainty Domain (Domain 8) and Chapter 14:  
   • Scenario: A complex engineering project dealing with unpredictable environmental conditions. By combining advanced risk identification tools from Chapter 14 with PMBOK® 7’s approach in Domain 8, the team sets robust contingency plans for extreme weather events and supply chain disruptions.  
   • Result: Smoother adaptation and less budgetary impact from unforeseen events.

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

• Pitfall: Treating PMBOK® 7 as if it were solely an agile guide.  
  – Best Practice: Remember that the new edition supports all modalities—predictive, agile, and hybrid. Leverage both this book’s chapters and PMBOK® 7 to tailor the right mix of processes, artifacts, and methods.

• Pitfall: Overlooking the 12 principles by focusing only on the performance domains.  
  – Best Practice: Develop a keen awareness of how each principle underpins the domains. For instance, you cannot effectively manage risk (Domain 8) without also embracing adaptiveness and resilience (Principle 11).

• Pitfall: Failing to connect new knowledge areas (e.g., complexities, advanced leadership, emerging technologies) with the foundational performance domains.  
  – Best Practice: Use cross-reference sections—like this one—to map advanced topics to PMBOK® 7’s existing structure, thus maintaining coherence.

• Pitfall: Mixing up older knowledge area terminologies with the new principle- and domain-based approach.  
  – Best Practice: Recognize that while “Integration Management” or “Scope Management” are still valuable conceptual groupings, PMBOK® 7 focuses more on outcomes and value, so adapt your vocabulary accordingly.
