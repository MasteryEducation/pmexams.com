## 40.3 PMBOK® Guide Seventh Edition Terminology

The PMBOK® Guide Seventh Edition marks a significant evolution in the landscape of project management theory and practice. Reflecting the global shift toward flexibility, adaptability, and value-oriented delivery, this edition introduces new terminology and reframes established concepts. While previous editions focused on process groups and knowledge areas, the Seventh Edition centers on principles, performance domains, and an overall system for delivering project value. In this section, we clarify key terms that define the modern language of project management. We also highlight how they interrelate and how they can be applied in practical scenarios to support successful, high-impact project outcomes.

  
### The Purpose of Evolving Terminology

PMI’s move from a prescriptive process-based approach to a principles-based approach stems from the realization that every project environment is unique. The Seventh Edition vocabulary enables professionals to tailor core concepts to specific contexts—be they predictive waterfall projects, dynamic agile settings, or hybrid frameworks. These new terms support project practitioners in moving from rigid compliance to more holistic, value-driven decision-making.

  
### Principles Over Processes

Unlike the Sixth Edition, which prescribed 49 project management processes organized into knowledge areas and process groups, the Seventh Edition highlights 12 Project Management Principles (see Chapter 5 for a deep dive). These principles are fundamental beliefs and guidelines that project managers and teams should embody throughout the project life cycle. While process-based knowledge is still relevant, the core emphasis shifts to the mindset and behaviors that produce value. This approach encourages:

- Flexibility and creativity in managing unique project needs.  
- Collaboration with stakeholders to maximize benefits.  
- Continuous learning and adaptation, rather than rigid adherence to fixed processes.

  
### Key Seventh Edition Terminology

Below are some of the most noteworthy terms and concepts introduced or redefined in the PMBOK® Guide Seventh Edition. Where appropriate, references to other chapters of this book are provided so you can dig deeper into a topic.

  
#### Value Delivery System

A “Value Delivery System” refers to the broad framework through which organizations structure their strategies, portfolios, programs, and projects to deliver products, services, and results that generate tangible or intangible value. Unlike the narrower process-based approach of earlier editions, this concept reminds practitioners that projects are not isolated events. Instead, projects, programs, and portfolios create a system that should continuously deliver value to customers, stakeholders, and the organization.

Example in Practice:  
• In a manufacturing company, the Value Delivery System might encompass the organization’s strategic portfolio (e.g., investing in new production lines), each program’s goals (e.g., automation improvements), and individual projects (e.g., implementing a robotic welding unit). All efforts aim to enhance quality, reduce costs, and generate value for customers and business stakeholders.

  
#### Performance Domains

The PMBOK® Guide Seventh Edition replaces the traditional knowledge areas covered by the Sixth Edition with eight “Project Performance Domains.” These represent high-level areas of focus that are essential for successful project outcomes (see Chapters 7 through 14 of this book for deeper explanations). The domains include:

- Stakeholder  
- Team  
- Development Approach and Life Cycle  
- Planning  
- Project Work  
- Delivery  
- Measurement  
- Uncertainty  

Each domain intersects with others, collectively ensuring a holistic approach to managing a project. Where “Communications Management” was previously a standalone knowledge area, communication is now integrated within multiple domains—especially Stakeholder, Team, and Planning—reflecting its pervasive influence on project success.

  
#### Tailoring

Tailoring is the deliberate act of contextualizing and adapting project management practices, methods, and artifacts to fit the specific needs of a project. Instead of following a strict formula, project managers customize their approaches based on the organization’s environment, stakeholder expectations, risk profile, team skills, and project complexity. Tailoring resonates with many of the Twelve Principles by encouraging the project manager to “think critically” and use “organizational and situational awareness” to adopt or modify best practices as needed.

Example in Practice:  
• In a software development project with frequent requirement changes, the team may tailor an agile framework to allow for extended sprint reviews or daily stakeholder checkpoints. Meanwhile, a government infrastructure project might need more predictive, documentation-heavy processes due to strict compliance and regulatory requirements.

  
#### Models, Methods, and Artifacts

Instead of prescribing a rigid set of processes, the PMBOK® Guide Seventh Edition highlights “Models, Methods, and Artifacts” as a flexible toolkit supporting the Performance Domains.  

- Models: Conceptual frameworks or theoretical constructs (e.g., Tuckman’s Ladder for team development).  
- Methods: Techniques and procedures applied within a model (e.g., root cause analysis for quality control).  
- Artifacts: Tangible outputs and documentation (e.g., project charter, risk register).

By categorizing these tools in this way, practitioners are free to select and adapt effectively, ensuring the right level of governance, oversight, and agility. This approach fosters continuous learning and evolution, in line with the Seventh Edition’s broader concept of creativity and adaptability.

  
#### System for Value Delivery

Often used interchangeably with “Value Delivery System,” a “System for Value Delivery” is essentially how the organization’s strategic goals and day-to-day operations are interwoven to produce sustainable benefits. Projects are the mechanisms that realize these benefits by translating strategy into execution.  

• At the Strategic Level: Organizational leaders set directions and identify initiatives.  
• At the Portfolio Level: Portfolios align initiatives and allocate resources.  
• At the Program Level: Related projects are coordinated for synergies.  
• At the Project Level: Outputs and outcomes are generated, delivering specific facets of value.

This system perspective underscores that a single project’s success depends on how well it fits into the larger ecosystem of organizational objectives and capabilities.

  
#### Principles of Stewardship, Leadership, and Stakeholder Engagement

The Seventh Edition underscores the importance of ethical and effective leadership as a foundation. Terms such as “Stewardship” emphasize responsibly managing resources and focusing on the organization’s holistic wellbeing. Meanwhile, leadership is no longer solely top-down; it emphasizes collaboration, servant leadership, and empathy. Stakeholder Engagement is similarly broadened beyond standard communications to include proactive collaboration and conflict resolution.  

For instance, see Chapter 7 on the Stakeholder Performance Domain, where engagement goes beyond stakeholder identification to fostering relationships that build trust, capture feedback, and enable the project to achieve its intended value.  

  
#### Holistic Thinking and Systems Thinking

The Seventh Edition frequently mentions “Systems Thinking,” where the project manager sees the entire end-to-end context—people, processes, technologies, environmental factors, and the interactions among them. This holistic view is critical for complex projects that:

- Involve interdependent technological components.  
- Span multiple geographic and cultural contexts.  
- Require ongoing feedback loops to manage dynamic stakeholder needs.

One of the 12 Project Management Principles (see Chapter 5) addresses the need for “Systems Thinking,” reinforcing that project actions do not happen in isolation. Instead, project managers and teams must view the bigger picture and anticipate the full range of influences and consequences.

  
#### Outcomes Versus Deliverables

Where earlier editions placed heavy emphasis on project deliverables, the Seventh Edition broadens the perspective to emphasize outcomes and benefits. While deliverables (tangible or intangible products, services, or results) are still relevant, the ultimate measure of success is the value or broader outcome these deliverables generate for stakeholders or the organization.  

Example:  
• In an e-commerce website redesign project, the deliverable is a revamped, user-friendly platform. However, the outcome is increased customer satisfaction and improved conversion rates.  

  
#### Risk, Uncertainty, and Complexity

Risk management remains crucial, but the new terminology highlights the idea of “uncertainty” (see Chapter 14 for more details) as a broader concept that includes both unknown risks and unknown unknowns. “Complexity” refers to elevated levels of interdependency or unpredictability. The Seventh Edition encourages adaptive risk strategies, continuous learning, and emergent thinking.  

  
#### Adaptability and Resilience

These two interlinked terms appear throughout the Seventh Edition:

- Adaptability: The capacity to adjust methodologies, resources, or priorities as changes arise in project scope, stakeholder needs, or external conditions.  
- Resilience: The project’s and team’s ability to recover from setbacks, pivot swiftly, and continue to move forward.

Practitioners are encouraged to cultivate both adaptability and resilience at the individual, team, and organizational levels.  

  
#### Governance and Decision-Making

Project governance in the Seventh Edition context means creating the right structures and policies to guide decision-making. It empowers the project team with clarity on roles, responsibilities, and escalation paths, ensuring alignment with the organization’s strategic goals. Transparency in governance fosters trust and confidence among stakeholders, as decisions are made systematically and ethically.

  
### Visualizing the Transition

The following Mermaid diagram illustrates how the Seventh Edition’s approach focuses first on principles and performance domains, then applies adaptive models, methods, and artifacts to align with the overarching Value Delivery System.

```mermaid

    A["Principles <br/>(Mindsets & Behaviors)"] --> B["Performance Domains <br/>(Areas of Focus)"]
    B --> C["Models, Methods,<br/> & Artifacts <br/>(Flexible Toolkit)"]
    C --> D["Value Delivery System <br/>(Organizational Strategy & Benefits)"]
```

**Diagram Explanation:**  
1. Principles (“A”) form the fundamental mindset guiding any approach to project planning and execution.  
2. The Performance Domains (“B”) represent the aggregated areas where the principles are put into action.  
3. Within those domains, the selection of “Models, Methods, & Artifacts” (“C”) provides an adaptable toolkit fitting the project context.  
4. All these elements collectively stay aligned with the broader “Value Delivery System” (“D”), ensuring every project remains connected to strategic benefits.

  
### Practical Application and Case Study

Consider a large healthcare project aiming to integrate telehealth solutions across multiple clinics. In earlier PMBOK® editions, a project manager might have focused on rigid process-based scheduling, cost controlling, and scope management. However, in the Seventh Edition paradigm:

1. The project manager and team begin by applying the principle of “Stakeholder Engagement,” working closely with clinicians, IT staff, regulatory bodies, insurance companies, and patients to identify the true needs and constraints.  
2. Using “Tailoring,” they select a hybrid approach that combines agile sprints (for software development) with predictive phases (for compliance and procurement).  
3. They focus on the “Delivery” performance domain to ensure each clinic receives the telehealth application modules in a manner consistent with user acceptance, training, and local regulations.  
4. They measure not only technical deliverables—like software modules—but also outcomes, such as patient satisfaction and reduced appointment wait times, aligning with the organization’s Value Delivery System.  

  
### Common Misconceptions

- “All Old Terminology Is Obsolete”: Not true. Terms like “charter,” “critical path,” “work breakdown structure,” and so forth remain relevant; they are simply placed within a broader spectrum of domains, models, and methods.  
- “Agile Is Mandatory”: While the Seventh Edition references agile and hybrid approaches, it does not mandate them. Instead, it encourages context-driven tailoring, which may well include predictive, agile, or hybrid methods.  
- “Principles Replace Processes Entirely”: The new guide does not forbid processes. Rather, it expects project managers to apply processes that align with the principles and performance domains, fulfilling the unique needs of each project environment.

  
### Best Practices and Pitfalls

**Best Practices:**  
- Continuously engage stakeholders to maintain alignment with value-based outcomes.  
- Cultivate adaptability and resilience across teams by encouraging an open, supportive culture.  
- Provide clarity in governance with accessible decision-making frameworks and well-documented escalation paths.

**Potential Pitfalls:**  
- Over-tailoring or failing to define clear processes can introduce confusion.  
- Neglecting leadership and stewardship principles may cause resource misuse or ethical dilemmas.  
- Focusing solely on deliverables without ensuring they lead to meaningful outcomes will reduce perceived value.

  
### Final Thoughts and Further Reading

Embracing the latest PMBOK® Guide Seventh Edition terminology reflects more than a semantic change; it represents a shift toward people-centric, value-driven, and adaptable project management. Terms like “Value Delivery System,” “Performance Domains,” and “Tailoring” reinforce how project professionals can holistically adapt to rapidly changing environments while still anchoring projects to organizational strategy.
